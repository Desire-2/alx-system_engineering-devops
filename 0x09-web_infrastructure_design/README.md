# Project: 0x09. Web Infrastructure Design

## Overview

This project focuses on designing various web infrastructures, exploring concepts such as DNS, monitoring, web servers, network basics, load balancers, and servers. The goal is to develop a deeper understanding of these components and their interactions in creating robust and scalable web environments.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you are expected to:

- Draw a diagram covering the web stack developed in SysAdmin/DevOps track projects.
- Explain the role of each component in the infrastructure.
- Understand system redundancy and potential single points of failure.
- Be familiar with acronyms like LAMP, SPOF, QPS.

## Concepts

Concepts covered in this project include DNS, Monitoring, Web Server, Network basics, Load balancer, and Server.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Simple web stack
- Design a one-server web infrastructure hosting www.foobar.com using a LAMP stack.
- Components: 1 server, 1 web server (Nginx), 1 application server, 1 application files (code base), 1 database (MySQL), 1 domain name (foobar.com) with a www record pointing to server IP.
- Explain specifics about the infrastructure and identify issues (SPOF, Downtime during maintenance, Cannot scale with high traffic).

### Task 1: Distributed web infrastructure
- Design a three-server web infrastructure hosting www.foobar.com.
- Components: 2 servers, 1 web server (Nginx), 1 application server, 1 load balancer (HAproxy), 1 set of application files (code base), 1 database (MySQL).
- Explain specifics about the infrastructure and identify issues (SPOF, Security issues, No monitoring).

### Task 2: Secured and monitored web infrastructure
- Design a three-server web infrastructure hosting www.foobar.com with security measures.
- Components: 3 firewalls, 1 SSL certificate for HTTPS, 3 monitoring clients.
- Explain specifics about the infrastructure and identify issues (SSL termination at the load balancer, Single MySQL server for writes, Uniform components on servers).

### Task 3: Scale up (Advanced)
- Add components to the web infrastructure, including a server, load balancer (HAproxy), and separate servers for web server, application server, and database.
- Explain the rationale behind each addition.
