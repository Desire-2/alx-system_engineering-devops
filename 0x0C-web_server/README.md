# 0X0C - Web Server

![Web Server Block Diagram](https://www.keil.com/pack/doc/mw/Network/html/http_server_block_diagram.png)

Web servers are composed of both hardware and software that utilize the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to respond to requests from web users on the World Wide Web.

__NOTE:__ For this project, certain tasks will be evaluated based on two criteria:

1. Is your web-01 server configured as per the requirements?
2. Does your answer file include a Bash script that can automatically execute commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to meet the requirements, without any manual intervention?

## Learning Objectives

A proficient software engineer is often characterized as a lazy one, believe it or not.

## Installing Required Packages

```bash

$ sudo apt-get install shellcheck -y

# Check shellcheck version

$ shellcheck -V

# Installing nginx

$ sudo apt-get install nginx -y

```

## Configuring Nginx

```bash

# Configuring the default file

$ sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

# Once the vi editor opens

server {
  listen 80 default_Server;
  root /var/www/html;
  index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

# if you have a domain name replace '_' with it
  server_name _;

# configuring error_page
  error_page 404 404.html;

  location / {
	try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

  location = /404.html {
	internal;
  }
}

```
